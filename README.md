# MLOps Project Group 62

## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to forecast wind power production at the Klim Windfarm. 

## Used frameworks
The project will initially employ the pytorch-forecasting library for model construction. Due to limited experience with this framework, there is consideration for a potential transition to PyTorch Lightning, known for its simpler model implementation approach compared to standard PyTorch.

## Data
We will use the following dataset -> http://www.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02427/comp_ex_4_scripts_2011.zip. However, we intend to migrate to an alternative dataset that provides a continuous stream of new and diverse data.

## Models
We expect to use some kind of auto-regressive model like RNN, LSTM or Transformer. Variations might be interesting too for better forecasting results, like the Temporal Fusion Transformer.

## Project structure

The directory structure of the project looks like this:
